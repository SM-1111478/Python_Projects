* Print the final grocery list
* Create a variable named replace that stores the user's input on whether they want to replace any items
* Use a while loop that loops as long as replace is not equal to "no":
  * Create a itemToReplace variable to store the user's input on the number of the item they wish to replace as an integer

  * Replace the number item from the grocery list with the new item the user inputs
  * Print the current list
